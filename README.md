# Self-Driving-Car
Self-Driving Car Model using Behavioral Cloning and NVIDIA CNN
This repository contains a self-driving car model implemented using behavioral cloning and the NVIDIA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The model is trained to autonomously drive a car in the Udacity Simulator using preprocessed images from the simulator. Flask and Socket.IO are utilized to establish bidirectional client-server communication between the simulator and the model.
